CSS Selectors (Cascading Style Sheet)

It is another way of locating elements on the web page

Syntax:     tag name[attribute = 'attribute value']
Ex:         input[value = 'LOGIN']

CSS doesn't give us an opportunity to locate the elements by its text

Shortcuts for CSS:

Shortcut for the className ----> "."
Syntax:     tag name.classNameValue
Ex:         input.button

Shortcut for ID -----> "#"
Syntax:     tag name#ID
Ex:         input#txtPassword

contains() method in css:
* symbol represents contains method
Syntax:     tag name[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']
Ex:         input[placeholder *= 'phone']

starts-with method in css:
^(Circumflex) symbol represents starts-with method
Syntax:    tag name[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
Ex:        input[aria-label ^=  'Pass']

ends-with method in css:
$ symbol represents ends-with method in css
Syntax:     tag name[attribute $= 'starting attribute value']
Ex:         a[href $=  'login']

Xpath vs CSS

-- CSS can't locate the elements by text whereas xpath can
-- CSS has shortcuts
-- Xpath doesn't have ends-with method
-- CSS is faster than xpath in locating elements
- CSS has more simple syntax than xpath
