What is software testing?
It identifies the correctness and quality of the application

How many ways we can actually test?
1)manual
2)automation

When do we fo for automation testing?
-after manual testing in passed
-when environment is stable
-analyze out test suit and choose our automation tools

What automation tools do we know about?
-Selenium, Cucumber,TestNG, JUnit, Katalon, Studio, UFT/QTP

Levels of testing:
-Unit testing           (done by developers)
-integration testing    (mostly done by QA)
-acceptance testing     (done by clients & end users)
-system testing         (done by development operations)

Types of testing:
-Functional testing
-Non Functional testing:
involves 2 types of testing
1) performance testing:how good app will work in a severe load (done by preformance tester)
2) security testing: making sure no-one can hack into your application or how easy it is to hack (done by security
or penetration tester)

What is Selenium:
It is a set of tools which helps us automate web applications. It is mainly used to perform functional testing

Selenium Components:
Selenium IDE(integrated development environment)-
Selenium Grid- Firefox plugin (kinda outdated)
Selenium WebDriver -(widely used)
Selenium RC - Remote Control

What is Selenium WebDriver:
Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on a web application
It's an interface

Advantages:
-open source
-works with different browsers & supports cross browsing testing
-OS independent - ios,Windows,Linux
-works w/ different programming languages ---java, javascript, ruby, python

Disadvantages:
-can't test desktop apps
-no tech support
-no built in reports
-can't test images, videos & captions(manual test required)

get() vs navigate()
- navigate can go back, forward & refresh
-get will wait for the page to fully load where as navigate will not
-get will not keep history of the browser - navigate does

close() vs quit()
-close() closes the current tab
-quit() closes the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximizing()
-maximize will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see the control panel(back, forward, refresh)
-fullscreen() will maximize the whole web page
