What is a WebElement?

anything we see on the web page is considered to be a web element
ex buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, etc

HTML- Hyper Text Markup Language

What is DOM
Document Object Model- is the browsers internal view of the webpage - AKA Developers tools or dev tools
Document----> a simple html document which represents the age we are inspecting
Objecy---> any line in HTML is considered to be an Object
Model-----> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of a web element on the webpage
is used to locate or identify web elements on the web page

8 Locators:
-ID
-Name
-TagName
-xPath
-LinkText
-PartialLinkText
-CssSelectors
-ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
-dev may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-some locators may not be applicable for what we're looking for
ex: linktext & partial linktext(they're only used for links or anchor tags

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes
