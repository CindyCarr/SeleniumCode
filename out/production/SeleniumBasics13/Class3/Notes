Selenium Class 03

Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
--> Developers may not provide all the locators in html

What is the biggest advantage of Xpath and CSS selector?
--> By using Xpath and CSS, we can identify the element with any given attributes.

what is actually Xpath?
--> It is like a query language helping us to identify elements uniquely on the web page.

Types of Xpath
Absolute Xpath --> starts from the starting node of the html
                    It always starts with a single slash (/)
                    e.g /html/body/div/div/div

Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in html
                --> Always starts with double slash (//)

Syntax for relative Xpath

//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']

e.g. //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text()='text value']

//a[text() = 'Create new account']
//h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

Identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
e.g.
//input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]
e.g.
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

starts - with will identify elements by its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

ex // input[starts-with(@aria-label,'Email')]

ends- with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 nd this method is not available

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent and child, sibling relationships

identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::siblingTagname
//label[@for = 'leaveList-calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by proceeding sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling:: sibilingTagname
ex //span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying elements by parents
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']parent::parentTagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying elements by ancestors
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying elements by its index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
